# OpenWave
Studies have shown that vibration applied to the body can influence the autonomic nervous system, with effects such as [decreasing blood pressure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X13002246?casa_token=3Bz_7xm9cvYAAAAA:t0JRxXMmVa5js-rsyLYofUtOFFrZLznl5uh9M57HsksGYMN3iqDjk_PQK5wYVplvsORyFxz0OQ), [modulation of inflammation](https://www.healio.com/news/rheumatology/20190417/vibration-stimulation-of-external-ear-alleviates-inflammation-in-ra) and [improved mood and alertness](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200061377A1/en?inventor=David+Mayer+Lowell+Rabin). 

OpenWave is a platform for experimenting with vibration stimulation using the vibration motor in Wear OS smartwatches. The watch can be programmed to generate two different frequencies simultaneously and vibration can be applied continuously even with the screen off.
